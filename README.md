## Alessandro Lollo · Career explorer

A database-inspired résumé for technical and executive recruiters. Built with **Jekyll, Liquid, custom CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**; no client framework, database, or new production dependencies. Career records remain in `_data/data.yml`. Overview and leadership summaries live in `_layouts/explorer.html`; update them when the underlying experience changes. Role links use the ordering in `experiences.info` (zero-based record IDs).

Experience supports text filtering and expandable records; leadership, tools, contributions, and education have dedicated views. Content renders without JavaScript. Native links, visible keyboard focus, responsive career cards, reduced-motion support, and the existing `/print` résumé are retained. The SQL snippet is a profile illustration, not an executable query editor.

Run `bundle install` then `bundle exec jekyll serve`. The site uses the `/alelollo-online-cv/` path. `_config.yml` sets `url` to `https://alessandrolollo.github.io` and `baseurl` to `/alelollo-online-cv`. The upstream theme's `online-cv.webjeda.com` CNAME has been removed. For your own custom domain, add its CNAME and set `baseurl: ''`.

Run browser regression checks against the running site:

```sh
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm test
```

`CV_BASE_URL` overrides the site URL; `CHROMIUM_PATH` selects an existing Chromium executable. Tests check navigation, filtering, empty results, record links, local assets, layouts at 320–1440px, no-JavaScript content, and the printable résumé. CI builds and serves Jekyll before running the checks.

The original Orbit documentation follows, including attribution for the retained printable résumé.
